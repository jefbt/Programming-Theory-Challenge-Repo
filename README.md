# Programming-Theory-Challenge-Repo
Challenge of the Unity Jr Programming Course

This is a simple repository for the Programming Theory Challenge, from Unity Jr Programming Mission.

It's intended to help the student learn the four pillars of Object Oriented Programming - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.

This is a simple space "bullet hell", but it's not really a bullet hell.

The player can't fire anything and it needs to recover some lost things throughout space.

Off course it will find other ships trying to prevent it from getting the lost items, and they will shoot.
